This directory contains most of the sample code from the "Lucene In Action"
book by Erik Hatcher and Otis Gospodnetic. To purchase an electronic or
printed copy of the book, visit http://www.manning.com/hatcher2

The samples that were not ported depend on some third party java code not
available or compatible to python-lucene++ or is related to remote searching 
which is not supported by python-lucene++ at this time.

R E Q U I R E M E N T S
-----------------------
  * python 2.4
  * python-lucene++ 0.1+
  * for the FileIndexer.py sample, some text extraction is handled by third
    party programs invoked as a sub-process. The code assumes that these
    programs are on the PATH:
    - PDF files: 
      pdftotext and pdfinfo, both available from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf
    - MS Word files: antiword
      antiword available from http://www.winfield.demon.nl
    - RTF files:
      not implemented

I N S T A L L A T I O N
-----------------------
Before any of the samples can be run, some Lucene indexes need to be
created by running 'index.py':
   - python index.py

R U N N I N G
-------------
Each of the files in this directory should be run from the command line:
   - python BooleanQueryTest.py

All the tests can be run by running:
   - python RunAll.py
